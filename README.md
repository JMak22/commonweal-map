# Draft: Map(s) of the Commonweal, based on the novels of Graydon Saunders

I'm keen on visual representations of information and I like looking at maps. Recently (last year or so) I got into making maps. This project is my first foray into making visual descriptions of territory based simply on writing. Feedback with sources is appreciated.

The PNG map should be taken to be the current, most up to date draft. The SVG map is a sketch based on a close reading of Book 5, "A Mist of Grit and Splinters" and has errors. It's the more legible of the two, despite having a transparent background. :)

## Features to be placed:
- Westcreek Town
- Headwaters
- Slow Creek 
- Lost Creek (features on Commonweal 5 svg map)
- canals 
- Awkward Lake
- Edge
- Cousins' territory
- River of Mists
- Corner (tentative, perhaps unneccessary) 

## Known issues with existing files:
- the position of the Paingyre is wrong on the SVG map
- proportions of Folded hills
- pencil sketch =/= good idea (blame my enthusiasm for getting something out to be shared with potential collaborators)

## World featues:
- story takes place on the southern hemisphere of the world, assuming it actually takes place on a planet and not something else (weirder)
- hostile environmental and magical features abound in the landscape, so if it's empty it generally means "there be dragons"
