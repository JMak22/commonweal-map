# Draft: Map(s) of the Commonweal, based on the novels of Graydon Saunders

I'm keen on visual representations of information and I like looking at maps. Recently (last year or so) I got into making maps. This project is my first foray into making visual descriptions of territory based simply on writing. Feedback with sources is appreciated.

The "Commonweal 1-2" map should be taken to be the current, most up to date draft. The SVG map is a sketch based on a close reading of Book 5, "A Mist of Grit and Splinters" and has errors. It's the more legible of the two, despite having a transparent background. :)

## Features to be placed:
- canals!
- Awkward Lake
- Old Lake
- Canal from "A Succession of Bad Days" linking Blue Creek with Old Lake and Morning Vale
- Edge
- Cousins' territory
- River of Mists
- Corner (tentative, perhaps unneccessary)

## Goals:
- decide if there will be a version of the map for each book (due to spoilers and developments over time and differing geographical focus in each work)
- finish with one, overall conceptual map
- find ways to convey plateaus, escarpments and river valleys visually (either by borrowing from existing terrestrial geography or getting gud at drawing)
- decide on scope for final version of map(s) -- visual identity, level of detail, colour palette, "feel"
- map all the things
- make an awesome final map
- celebrate!

## Known issues with existing files:
- the position of the Paingyre is wrong on the SVG map
- proportions of Folded hills
- pencil sketch =/= good idea (blame my enthusiasm for getting something out to be shared with potential collaborators)

## World featues:
- story takes place on the southern hemisphere of the world, assuming it actually takes place on a planet and not something else (weirder)
- hostile environmental and magical features abound in the landscape, so if it's empty it generally means "there be dragons"
